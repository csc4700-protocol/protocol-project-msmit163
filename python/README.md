# Running

From this directory, there are two options to run the parser:

Specifying the list of input values to the executable:

```
python app.py 1 2 3 4 5
```

Specifying the relative path to an examples file:

```
python app.py -f examples/example-1.txt
```

Input values in a test file are delimited by whitespace.

# Notes

* Do not change any code in the `app.py` file.
* You have free reign on the rest of the application, you may create other methods, classes, or files as necessary. For simplicity, please keep new files in the same directory.
* Do not delete the existing `example-1.txt` file.
* Other test files may be added to the `examples` directory and committed to your repository.
